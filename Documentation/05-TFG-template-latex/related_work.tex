\section{Related Work}
\label{sec-related-work}
A lot of research has been made of the brain to further understand it’s capabilities using deep learning algorithms. EEG signals can be used in many ways, below there are different projects with similar objectives of mental workload and seizure classification attempting to interpret and process EEG data, using deep learning techniques to develop frameworks to combine and process these signals.

\subsection{Mental Workload Detection based on EEG Analysis}
\leavevmode\\
A study of mental workload\cite{wrokload} is done in order to work more efficiently, healthier and to avoid accidents since workload compromises both performance and awareness. The use of EEG signals has a high correlation with specific cognitive and mental states such as workload, proposing a binary neural network to classify EEG features across different mental workloads.
\\
Mental workload is defined as “the cognitive and psychological effort to conclude a task”, observing that depending if workload is too heavy or too light this can affect human performance. 
\\
There are two main categories to measure workload:
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Subjective measures: Being the most used to asses mental workload, the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) a prominent way to gain insight on perceived workload from the subject based on a weighted average of six sub-variables: mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort and frustration. 
\item Physiological measures: Providing a more reliable data by measuring physiological dynamic changes which cannot be controlled consciously, so that is why it’s more reliable. Readings such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyograph, electroencephalogram (EEG)... The combination of inputs reports better accuracy than the analysis if each one independently.
\end{itemize}

The approach is to investigate the ability of 1D-CNN models to recognise two types of mental load from EEG signals and to generalise the model to a population not seen in the training set. They use N-back test (memory demanding games requiring the resolution of simple arithmetic operations adjusting workload) to induce low and medium workload and to classify a simple neural network (NN) it’s trained using only the power spectrum of theta waves. Proposing a personalized model for each individual and a generalist one, preform the models in a dataset of 16 subjects showing outstanding results in a leave-one-out subject test and so generalizing to new unseen subjects.
\\
The method to obtain data all 16 subjects had to first watch a 10-minute relaxing video and afterwards do the N-back-test low, medium and high difficulty. Finally subjects ask a TLX questionnaire for subjective perception of the test difficulty and workload.
\\
To get the data itself EEG recordings were done using EMOTIV EPOC+ headset which has 14 electrodes placed according to the 10/20 system which provide raw data and power spectrum for the main brain rhythms (theta, alpha, beta low, beta high, and), at 128 Hz and 8 Hz, respectively. 
\\
In conclusion its reported 95\% confidence interval for each class computed for all subjects and recall above 90\%. It is suggested to use longer windows to capture EEG non stationary nature.

\subsection{EEG Signal Dimensionality Reduction And Classification Using Tensor Decomposition And Deep Convolutional Neural Networks}
\leavevmode\\
This paper has a similar objective of seizure classification and uses the same dataset as this TFG.
\\
Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they still suffer from high dimensionality of the training data. The proposed tensor decomposition-based dimensionality reduction algorithm transforms a large set of slices of the input tensor to a concise set of slices which are called super-slices which handles the artifacts and redundancies of the EEG data and also reduces the dimension of the CNNs training inputs. This proposed framework is tested on HCB-MIT data and as results show, the approach outperforms other previous studies.

\subsection{Epileptic Seizures Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques: A Review}
\leavevmode\\
The advent deep learning algorithms in many areas of medicine, such as in the diagnosis of epileptic seizures, has made significant advances. In this study, a comprehensive overview of works focused on automated epileptic seizure detection using DL techniques and neuroimaging modalities is presented. Various methods proposed to diagnose epileptic seizures automatically using EEG and MRI modalities are described. In addition, rehabilitation systems developed for epileptic seizures using deep learning have been analysed, and a summary is provided. The rehabilitation tools include cloud computing techniques and hardware required for implementation of deep learning algorithms. Challenges, advantages and limitations in employing deep learning-based techniques for epileptic seizures diagnosis are presented as well as the most promising models and future works on automated epileptic seizure detection.

\subsection{Recognition of mental workload of pilots in the cockpit using EEG signals}
\leavevmode\\
The commercial flightdeck is a naturally multi-tasking work environment and so automatic characterization of pilot’s workload becomes essential. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have shown a high correlation to specific cognitive and mental states like workload. However, there is not enough evidence in the literature to validate how well models generalize in case of new subjects performing tasks of a workload similar to the ones included during model’s training. In this paper it’s proposed a convolutional neural network to classify EEG features across different mental workloads in a continuous performance task test that measures a portion of working memory and working memory capacity. Our model is valid at a general population level and it is able to transfer task learning to a pilot mental workload recognition in a simulated operational environment.
